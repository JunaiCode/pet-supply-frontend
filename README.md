## 🚀 Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

🛠 Admin Access for CRUD
To access the product management dashboard (CRUD), follow these steps:

Click on the gear icon (⚙️) located at the top right of the homepage.

Enter the following email to authenticate:

Copy
Edit
admin@gmail.com
If successful, you'll be redirected to the admin product CRUD panel.

This protects the admin interface behind a basic email check for demonstration purposes.
